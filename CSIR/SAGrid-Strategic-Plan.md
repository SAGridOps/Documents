SAGrid Strategic plan for SANREN Competency Area.

# Executive Summary

The South African National Grid (SAGrid) is a collaboration of universities, national laboratories and research groups, to operate a distributed e-Infrastructure[^cyberinfrastructure] which together form a Joint Research Unit (JRU)[^JRU]. A JRU agreement, in the form of an MoU between the constituent parties, provides the framework under which the activities of SAGrid are coordinated and executed. SAGrid is thus a collaborative umbrella project, operating in the area of e-Science services and infrastructure, as well as related support structures. 

<!--  how does SAGrid fit into NICI --> 
The NICI framework adopted in 2014 identifies SAGrid as a necessary component for cyberinfrastructure in South Africa. The role of SAGrid and strategy adopted to actualise the recommendations of the NICI report are described in this document and references contained therein. The interaction and relationship between other components of NICI are also described.

# Mission

SAGrid's mission is to increase the capability and functionality of existing or future computing resources and services in the Republic of South Africa, as well as providing leadership and support through collaborative projects to regional initiatives. This mission is motivated by central importance to scientific research held by e-Science tools, and the primary  is to ***support all forms of research dependent on these services.***

Primary goals of the initiative are to :

  1. extend and maintain the framework and basic infrastructure of the  national grid initiative,
  1. extend and maintain a suitable environment for distributed and collaborative research heavily dependent on HPC, HTC, data and other forms of computing to flourish
1. in the republic of South Africa specifically and
2. in specifically identified regions beyond the borders of the country.
3. A further goal is to participate and provide support, by integrating and consolidating the partiesâ€™ resources and thereby consolidating the existing computing and grid resources in the country, to common research activities.
4. Eventually, the parties wish to establish and maintain official links with international grid infrastructure and related projects.

# Glossary

[^JRU]: *JRU - Joint Research Unit* - A term used since the 5th Framework Package of the European Union - means a partnership with no legal status as such, formed between entities of the same nationality and meeting the following conditions:
  - scientific and economic unity; 
  - lasting a certain length of time; 
  - recognised by a public authority
JRU is composed by at least two legal entities. These entities will be the participants of the project. One of them is mandated in order to coordonate the JRU research activities.
Special conditions for use in Contracts to implement the 5th Framework Programme (Clause on participation by joint research units (JRU))
[^cyberinfrastructure]: The terms 'e-Infrastructure' (more in use in Europe) and cyberinfrastructure (preferred in the U.S.) will be used interchangeably. *Cyberinfrastructure* refers to the distributed computer, information and 
communication technologies combined with the personnel and integrating components that provide a 
long-term platform to empower the modern scientific research endeavor
[^HPC]: HPC : High-Performance Computing
[^HTC]: HTC : High-Throughput Computing
