<h1>SAGrid Strategic plan for SANREN Competency Area.</h1>

# Executive Summary

<!-- What is SAGrid ?-->
The South African National Grid (SAGrid) is a collaboration of universities, national laboratories and research groups, to operate a distributed, service-oriented e-Infrastructure[^cyberinfrastructure] which together form a Joint Research Unit (JRU)[^JRU]. A JRU agreement, in the form of an MoU between the constituent parties, provides the framework under which the activities of SAGrid are coordinated and executed. SAGrid is thus a collaborative umbrella project, operating in the area of e-Science services and infrastructure, as well as related support structures. 

<!--  how does SAGrid fit into NICI ? --> 
The [DST](http://www.dst.gov.za)[^DST] NICI[^NICI] framework adopted in 2014  identifies SAGrid as a necessary component for cyberinfrastructure in South Africa. The role of SAGrid and strategy adopted to actualise the recommendations of the NICI report are described in this document and references contained therein. The interaction and relationship between other components of NICI are also described. 

<!-- why is SAGrid part of SANREN ? -->
Although SAGrid is a federation, certain activities fall within the direct remit of the eventual NICI body - these are essentially the core coordination and development activities on which the collaboration is founded. The *"home"* for this coordination activity for similar initiatives worldwide differs - some fall under the remit of the NREN[^NREN], others fall within a national e-Science centre, and others under the national supercomputing centre. The activity is an *enabling* one, which exists to stimulate and support collaborative research, the needs of which cut across institutional boundaries.

<!-- how does SAGrid fit into AAROC -->
There are other NGIs[^NGI] in Africa, in various stages of maturity and development, which SAGrid collaborates and peers with to form the Africa-Arabia Regional Operations Centre[^AAROC]. AAROC is a regional coordination point which has been designed to allow interoperability between national and regional e-Infrastructures. SAGrid is the coordinating entity of the ROC.

# Mission

SAGrid's mission is to increase the capability and functionality of existing or future computing resources and services in the Republic of South Africa, as well as providing leadership and support through collaborative projects to regional initiatives. This mission is motivated by central importance to scientific research held by e-Science tools, and the primary  is to ***support all forms of research dependent on these services.***

<!-- This is lifted directly from the JRU document -->
Primary goals of the initiative are to :

  1. extend and maintain the framework and basic infrastructure of the  national grid initiative,
  1. extend and maintain a suitable environment for distributed and collaborative research heavily dependent on HPC, HTC, data and other forms of computing to flourish 
    1. in the republic of South Africa specifically and
    1. in specifically identified regions beyond the borders of the country.

Further goals of the initiative are to **participate** and **provide support**, by **integrating** and **consolidating** the partiesâ€™ resources and thereby consolidating the existing computing and grid resources in the country, to common support or research activities, including international projects.

## Interaction and roles with respect to NICI components (CHPC, DIRISA, SANREN)

The Meraka Institute of the CSIR[^CSIR] has played a central role in the development of the South African national cyberinfrastructure projects. The Centre for High-Performance Computing[^CHPC], the high-capacity South African National Research Network (SANREN)[^SANREN] and more recently, the Data-Intensive Research Infrastructure for South Africa (DIRISA)[^DIRISA]. Merak also coordinates the national grid. SAGrid considers HPC and data centres *resource providers*, and has the role of enabling resource sharing between them. Virtual Research Communities (VRCs) are thus, through the services offered by SAGrid and AAROC, able to use any combination of resources provided by the relevant sites. The infrastructure coordination is thus an integrative, enabling activit and as such acts as a kind of "glue" between various resource providers (including its own constituents) and  large cyberinfrastructure projects (including NICI and other e-Infrastructure providers). 

The role of SAGrid, particularly in respect to core cyberinfrastructure is to
  
> improve **access** to, **efficiency** and **interoperability** of the resources <br> 
> provided by as many sites as possible,  <br>
> for as many user communities as possible <br>
> to use as many services as necessary <br>
> in an easy, efficient way. <br>

## Infrastructure Coordination 

The mission of the SAGrid JRU is to act as the decision-making body of the federation, regarding long-term and mission-critical decisions. The JRU

# Glossary

[^JRU]: *JRU - Joint Research Unit* - A term used since the 5th Framework Package of the European Union - means a partnership with no legal status as such, formed between entities of the same nationality and meeting the following conditions:
  - scientific and economic unity; 
  - lasting a certain length of time; 
  - recognised by a public authority
JRU is composed by at least two legal entities. These entities will be the participants of the project. One of them is mandated in order to coordonate the JRU research activities.
Special conditions for use in Contracts to implement the 5th Framework Programme (Clause on participation by joint research units (JRU))

[^cyberinfrastructure]: The terms 'e-Infrastructure' (more in use in Europe) and cyberinfrastructure (preferred in the U.S.) will be used interchangeably. *Cyberinfrastructure* refers to the distributed computer, information and 
communication technologies combined with the personnel and integrating components that provide a 
long-term platform to empower the modern scientific research endeavor
